We have four types of test cases:

PSCAD Tests
===========

Run on PSCAD. A group of DGI connect to the PSCAD interface, which connects to
PSCAD. The PSCAD simulation is terrible and doesn't do a very good job of
finding bugs with the DGI, but this can catch any major issues. The DGI connect
to the PSCAD interface using the RTDS device adapter.

RSCAD Tests
===========

Run on the RTDS rack at FSU. The DGI use the RTDS device adapter.

Local RTDS Adapter Tests
========================

These are our first semi-automated tests. They can be run locally on one
computer. A LaTeX template is provided for recording results.

You will need the PSCAD interface running in the background: navigate to
pscad-interface/testing and start run_test.sh with no arguments. To start the
DGI, navigate to FREEDM/Broker/testing and start run_test.sh with two
arguments: the first 'rtds' and the second the same of the test to be run, e.g.
'./run_test.sh rtds BadXml1'.

When running the SingleDGI and MultipleDGI tests, you'll need to restart the
PSCAD interface each time with a different configuration. The first argument
is the name of the test to run (e.g. './run_test.sh MultipleDgi1'). If you fail
to do this, you will get bogus results!

Plug and Play Tests
===================

Our second set of semi-automated tests. For this, you will need two computers,
one a laptop with a removable USB Wi-Fi adapter. (The requirements for these
tests are a bit overkill: simulating any network loss would in theory suffice.)
Run with e.g. './run_test.sh pnp Configuration1'
